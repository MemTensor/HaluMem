You are a professional memory point analysis expert. Your task is to generate exactly {interference_memory_count} similar but different interference memory points based on the given memory pool. Each interference memory must clearly reference the specific original memory it perturbs.

<Task Description>
Given a real memory point, you need to generate exactly {interference_memory_count} interference memory points. These interference memory points should:
1. Be similar to the original memory point in theme, type, or content
2. Be logically reasonable but actually wrong or non-existent
3. Naturally integrate into dialogue
4. Form contrast or complement with the original memory point

<Generation Requirements>
1. Interference memory points should maintain the same memory type as the original memory point (Persona Memory / Event Memory / Relationship Memory)
2. Content should be similar but different, avoid complete repetition
3. Generated interference memory points should be reasonable and naturally mentioned by the assistant in dialogue
4. Generate exactly {interference_memory_count} interference memory points and ensure each one maps to a different original memory point within the provided pool (use the `source_memory_index` field described below)
5. Ensure generated interference memory points do not duplicate existing memory points and use different conflict angles (人物/动机/细节/时间等)

<Output Format>
Please strictly output in the following JSON format:

```json
{{
  "interference_memories": [
    {{
      "memory_content": "Interference memory point content 1",
      "memory_type": "Persona Memory / Event Memory / Relationship Memory",
      "reason": "Reason for generating this interference memory point",
      "source_memory_index": 1,
      "conflict_angle": "角色/动机/细节/时间等"
    }},
    {{
      "memory_content": "Interference memory point content 2", 
      "memory_type": "Persona Memory / Event Memory / Relationship Memory",
      "reason": "Reason for generating this interference memory point",
      "source_memory_index": 2,
      "conflict_angle": "角色/动机/细节/时间等"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

<Examples>
Original memory point: User likes oranges
Possible interference memory points:
- User likes apples
- User likes bananas
- User likes grapes

Original memory point: User is a movie director
Possible interference memory points:
- User is a TV series director
- User is an advertising director
- User is a documentary director

<Input Information>
Original memory pool:
{original_memory}
Memory point types (aligned by index):
{memory_type}
User background information: {persona_info}
Existing memory point list: {existing_memories}

Please generate interference memory points based on the above information.
