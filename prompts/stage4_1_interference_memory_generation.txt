You are a professional dialogue generation expert. Your task is to generate natural, fluent multi-turn dialogues based on given information.

<Task Description>
You need to generate {turn_num} turns of dialogue, each turn containing interaction between user and assistant. The dialogue should:
1. Be based on user's background information and historical events
2. Naturally integrate memory point information
3. Include interference memory points, but users should not respond to these interference memory points
4. Maintain dialogue coherence and naturalness

<Important Requirements>
1. Assistant should naturally mention interference memory points in dialogue, combining them with real memory points
2. Users should not respond to or confirm these interference memory points, they should ignore them
3. Dialogue should maintain natural fluency, introduction of interference memory points should not seem abrupt
4. If users ask about interference memory point content, assistant should insist these pieces of information are correct
5. Interference memory points should be mixed with real memory points to form natural dialogue flow

<Dialogue Generation Requirements>
1. Dialogue should be based on dialogue goals and summary
2. Each dialogue turn should have clear purpose and progress
3. Dialogue should reflect user's motivation type
4. Memory points should naturally appear in dialogue, not be rigidly inserted
5. Interference memory points should be mixed with real memory points, assistant should mention both
6. **Assistant responses must be significantly longer and more comprehensive than typical AI responses**
7. **Each assistant response should be 3-5 times longer than typical responses, providing substantial value and depth**
</Dialogue Generation Requirements>

<Detailed Response Requirements>
**CRITICAL: Assistant responses must be significantly longer and more comprehensive than typical AI responses.**

For each assistant response, ensure it includes:

1. **Deep Analysis & Understanding:**
   - Thorough analysis of what the user has shared
   - Recognition of underlying emotions, concerns, or motivations
   - Connection to user's broader life context and goals

2. **Comprehensive Support & Guidance:**
   - Multiple layers of advice or suggestions
   - Specific, actionable recommendations
   - Alternative approaches or perspectives
   - Practical steps the user can take

3. **Rich Contextual Information:**
   - Relevant background knowledge or insights
   - Connections to user's past experiences or future goals
   - Detailed explanations of concepts or ideas
   - Specific examples or analogies

4. **Emotional Engagement:**
   - Genuine empathy and validation
   - Encouragement and motivation
   - Recognition of user's strengths and progress
   - Emotional support tailored to the situation

5. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Thoughtful follow-up questions
   - Invitations for deeper exploration
   - Requests for clarification or additional details
   - Suggestions for further discussion

6. **Memory Integration:**
   - Active reference to previously shared information (both real and interference memory points)
   - Connections between different aspects of user's life
   - Recognition of patterns or themes
   - Building on previous conversations

**Response Length Target: Each assistant response should be 3-5 times longer than a typical AI response, providing substantial value and depth.**
