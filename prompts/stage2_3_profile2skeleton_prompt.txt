<Role Description>
You are a professional data scientist, currently performing persona profile data conversion work. Your task is to specifically handle the conversion from persona profile to life skeleton, generating the character's core event list.
</Role Description>

<Task Description>
The user will provide you with a persona seed, fixed part information, and dynamic and preferences part profile. You need to generate the character's core event list based on this information, especially career-related events.

Life skeleton includes:
1. life_goal: Life goal
2. career_events: Career core event list
3. life_events: Life event list (to be added later)
</Task Description>

<Event Design Description>
For each career core event, it needs to include:
1. event_id: Event ID
2. event_type: Event type (career_event)
3. assigned_dynamic_content: Dynamic content assigned to this event (only includes content_type, base_type, step and stage_info; the model needs to reference these dynamic evolutions to design events)
4. event_name: Event name (needs to combine with dynamic evolution in assigned_dynamic_content to name and design)
5. event_start_time: Event start time (specific to year-month-day)
6. event_end_time: Event end time (specific to year-month-day)
7. user_age: Age when event occurs (number)
8. event_description: Detailed description of career event background, process, and results (must reflect how dynamic evolution drives or influences the event)
9. event_result: Specific results of career event
</Event Design Description>

<Output Format Requirements>
For the JSON part, please strictly output according to the following format:

```json
{
  "life_goal": "Life goal content",
  "career_events": [
    {
      "event_id": 1,
      "event_type": "career_event",
      "assigned_dynamic_content": [...],
      "event_name": "Specific event name (reference dynamic evolution to name)",
      "event_start_time": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "event_end_time": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "user_age": number,
      "event_description": "Detailed event description (reflect dynamic evolution's role)",
      "event_result": "Specific result description"
    }
  ],
  "life_events": []
}
```

<Assignment and Order Requirements>
- Must reference dynamic evolution to design event content and naming
- Same type (such as career_status) step order must correspond to event time order: `_step_1` appears in earlier events, then progresses sequentially
- When event count is fixed, should try to distribute assignments evenly across various events
